# GarudaBlaze
Lighting Up Hidden Risks

GarudaBlaze is a browser extension that performs automated security design reviews on any given screen. It leverages the Gemini LLM for intelligent analysis and provides instant feedback on high-level security risks and sensitive assets present on web pages.

## Features

- **Automated Security Review:** Analyze any web page for security risks with a single click.
- **Asset Identification:** Detects sensitive assets such as PII, tokens, and more.
- **LLM-Powered Analysis:** Uses the Gemini model for context-aware, nuanced security insights.
- **Modern UI:** Built with React and Vite for a fast, responsive experience.

## How It Works

1. **Extracts Page Content:** The extension captures visible text and structure from the current web page.
2. **Sends Data to Gemini:** The captured data is sent to the Gemini LLM for analysis.
3. **Displays Results:** Security risks and sensitive assets are displayed in the extension popup.
